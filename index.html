  <p id = "bio">my favorite hobby is coding in my free time. Whenever I get home from school I always think of something, no matter when I am bored or when I am doing a project. I know that staring at a screen is a bad habit but serously, coding is a fun topic to learn about and I  personally think it is an intresting topic to learn about and use.</p>
